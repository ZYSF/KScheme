# KScheme
An updated &amp; refactored version of Mini-Scheme, a public domain Scheme interpreter.

## Introduction

This is about as simple of an implementation of Scheme (a very flexible LISP-like programming language) as you'll find.

It's based on Mini-Scheme, but has been updated and refactored mostly to make it compile and work properly under modern compilers and operating systems (it should build out-of-the-box on Visual Studio 2019).

*TODO: More documentation, more features, etc.*
